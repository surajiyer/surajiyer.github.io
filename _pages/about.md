I am a recent graduate data scientist, currently working in telecom. I analyze and explore real-world customer operations data with the help of machine learning and Python expertise. My motto is to never repeat analysis the same way twice, rather to always explore new approaches to keep learning. The types of analysis I work on regularly include NLP & clustering analysis on customer feedback, churn models, CLTV etc. My goal is to bring newer (but not always complicated!) and generalizable approaches to automating repeated descriptive analysis tasks, e.g. customer feedback mining. This blog is another avenue for myself to learn and share new things. Beyond work and being a nerd, I currently live in the Netherlands. I enjoy parties, EDM music, 🍔 > 🍕, and occasionally swimming.
