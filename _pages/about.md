Getting started
======

Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. I created this space to showcase any and all random thoughts I have on the subject of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data science or other interesting facts of life that I learn in general. I hail from the bustling city of Mumbai, India and currently reside in the high-tech Brainport-region of the Netherlands.

I am passionate about AI as a field that stitches together concepts from Computer Science, Neuroscience and Philosophy. The deeper we delve into AI, the greater the need arises to introspect our thoughts. This fun exercise allows us to explore how our mind works (of which a lot I will share), how we perceive the environment around us (as agents within) and on this journey, we may also learn truly personal unique attributes about ourselves.

**Some background about myself**: I am a Data Scientist. I recently graduated (2018) with a Masters in Computer Science and Data science as my specialization track from TU Eindhoven. My bachelors (same university) is in Software Engineering. Put together, I perform analysis and Machine learning projects in my day-to-day work and side projects with Software Engineering principles in mind. I firmly believe in the idea to "Never stop learning", which includes solving similar problems (when the need arises) each time in challenging new ways. I play well in a team, am a strong advocate of having knowledge sharing sessions within teams and do not shy from sharing ideas for general team improvement stuff. I work @ VodafoneZiggo within the Customer Operations and Process department. From technical skills perspective, I usually employ a lot of NLP text analytics, Regression analysis and predictive modelling surrounding customer service and process related tasks. Outside work, you will find me involved in basic fitness, Yoga and / or swimming related activities, side projects, travelling (I am in Europe after all) and enjoying music festivals.
